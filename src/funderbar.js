//PART II

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
  Now you will start using logic to pass your tests. You will be using comparators to pass the tests.
*/
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------

//_.same takes two parameters and returns whether they are the equal or not

//_.greater takes two numbers as parameters and checks if a is greater than b

//_.lessThan takes two numbers as parameters and checks if a is less than b

  //In the next tests you will be given four parameters to compare, sort of.
  //You will be given a, b, c, and d. Within your function you will compare 
  //a to b as well as comparing c to d. You will then compare their outcomes with
  //each other using the && or || logic to return true or false. 
  //EXAMPLE 3 > 2 && 5 === 6
  //The above example will evaluate to False because 3 > 2 === True and 5 === 6 False,
  // as you learned in the Learn content True && False evaluates to False.
  //For the _.andAnd function as well as the _.oror function you will just be using the === comparator

  //_.andAnd will be using the && comparator

    _.forIfElseStr = function(a){

    //In this function you will loop though the passed in array. Prior to that you need to check the second parameter to determine what you will be returning. 
    //If the second parameter is 'string' return a sentence created using the strings in the array. If the second parameter is 'number' you will return the total of the number in the array. 
    //You may notice you did this work already in previous functions but need to combine them in some way. Ideally, you should call the previous two functions in your implementation instead of copy/pasting the 'guts'.
